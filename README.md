A decoration mod meant to be simple and well-featured.
It adds a bunch of cute cubes, various mechanisms and stuff for [cutting](https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=14085), [enchanting](https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=14087), cooking, etc.
This mod is a lightweight alternative to HomeDecor and MoreBlocks.
